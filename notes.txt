Make a Member class -- we wont need to store these objects since they go directly into the DB, but i think it will clean things up

do you know how we will make the IDs? does oracle or sql have something that we do it for us or will we need to write functions to create unique IDs
 -- I am not sure, but I think Oracle will auto generate the IDs for us... I'll figure it out once we get there
 -- We are gonna need to make the IDs ourselves... my thought is just using a count... maybe a string plus a running count somehow

Q: Do we need constructors? I feel like we should just use the objects to perform actions in the database...
   bc we aren't gonna actually store an object for every member in the DB, for example.


Also, there are tables that i think we need to populate on our own

- employee tables
- ski resort properties
- lifts
- lesson types
- probably more stuff too, we can figure exactly what needs to be inputed vs manually populated especially for dependencies
